# Zelo*s "Light" Blocklist - for a better internet
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# Title: Zelo72 - Light
#
# A lightweight blocklist for ad blockers who have
# problems with large lists.
#
# Blocks:
#    ads, tracking, metrics and telemetry.
#
# This blocklist was designed to avoid false 
# positive domains as much as possible and
# not to block any needed features.
# Maximum blocking with full functionality.
#
# It was compiled from numerous sources, 
# my own blacklist and various whitelists.
# To keep the list as small as possible, 
# dead domains are removed regularly.
#
# It is updated daily and is available in
# the following formats:
#   domains, hosts and adblock.
#   See: https://github.com/Zelo72
#
# Created for purely personal, private use.
# Keep the internet clean!
