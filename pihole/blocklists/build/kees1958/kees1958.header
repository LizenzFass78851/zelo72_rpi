# Title: EU US most prevalent ads & trackers ABP format for uBlockOrigin and Adguard.

# After the previous experience of adding false positives by adding a new source to this list,
# I decided to create a second file, so any false positives introduced with this new source
# will not impact existing users of the EU_US-most_used blocklist. This list nearly doubles
# in rules, because the threshold was lowered to (highter than) one percent marketshare.
